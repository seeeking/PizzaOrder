# PizzaOrder

Found the project description on an [open course](http://cs75.tv/2012/summer/#about,projects). 

This project is done mainly in JQuery and Spring. Although XML is used to fetch the menu, JSON is used to pass data between the client and server.

The next step would be provide a way for restaunt to login and creat their own manus. Hopefully, this will evolve into something useful.
